# Image Resizer

This utility will resize images from 3 medias:
- Single Image
- Batch/Folder Resize
- From URL

It's a simple console app that walks the user through the options.  The user can choose to resize to a certain width, height, or a minimum size.

The code can easily be used internally in file uploads for websites and applications as well.

No nuget packages or other dependencies are needed in the current version.
